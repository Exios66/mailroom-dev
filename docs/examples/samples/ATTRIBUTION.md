# Sample Attribution & Licenses

The pilot sample set mixes **real public-domain / CC-BY-4.0 documents** with
**original text written for this repo**. Every file is tracked in
`docs/examples/samples/manifest.csv` (columns `source` + `license`).

## Real contracts — CUAD / The Atticus Project

The contract PDFs under `docs/examples/samples/contract/` come from the
[**Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD)**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/theatticusproject/cuad),
maintained by The Atticus Project (see the [CUAD datasheet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06268)).

- License: **CC BY 4.0** (per the HF dataset card for `theatticusproject/cuad`).
- The contracts are SEC filing exhibits (S-1/8-K/10-K) and were already public
  filings; CUAD republishes them under CC BY 4.0.

## LegalBench — MAUD v1 merger agreements

The six `legalbench_*.txt` files under `docs/examples/external/legalbench/` are the
**full merger agreement texts behind LegalBench's 34 `maud_*` tasks**
(see [LegalBench](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench) and the
[MAUD paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00876)). They come from **MAUD v1**
(*Merger Agreement Understanding Dataset*, curated by The Atticus Project),
available at Zenodo: **DOI 10.5281/zenodo.7500064**.

- License: **CC BY 4.0** (per the MAUD v1 Zenodo record and paper appendix A.1).
- The agreements are SEC-sourced public merger agreements (2021 ABA Public
  Target Deal Points Study corpus).
- Attribution: *The Atticus Project — MAUD v1*,
  `10.5281/zenodo.7500064`, accessed 2026; task framing via
  `nguha/legalbench` (CC BY 4.0).
- Fetched by `scripts/fetch_external_samples.py --source legalbench`.

## Pile of Law — court opinions (public-domain subsets only)

The six `pileoflaw_*.txt` files under `docs/examples/external/pileoflaw/` are U.S.
court opinions from the **`courtlistener_opinions`** subset of
[**Pile of Law**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pile-of-law/pile-of-law).

- The **Pile of Law compilation is CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** and is deliberately
  **not** committed; only **public-domain U.S. government works** (court
  opinions) are sampled and redistributed here — per the Pile of Law paper
  (arXiv:2207.00220, appendix E), all U.S. government-generated content is
  public domain, and these opinions were originally published by U.S. courts
  via CourtListener.
- License: **public domain (U.S. government work)**.
- Attribution: *Pile of Law* `pile-of-law/pile-of-law` on Hugging Face
  (`courtlistener_opinions` subset), accessed 2026; opinions sourced from
  CourtListener (per-document URLs in each file header).
- Fetched by `scripts/fetch_external_samples.py --source pileoflaw`.

## Synthetic PDFs — original text

The PDFs for compliance, corporate, correspondence, insurance, and due diligence
classes are generated from original `.txt` text under `docs/examples/sources/`
by `scripts/prepare_samples.py` (ReportLab). The text is written for this project
and is not copied from any dataset; it is styled after common document types
(10-K annual report, state filing, bylaws, board resolution, demand letter,
internal memo, FNOL / coverage-determination letters, due diligence
report/checklist). The three insurance letters
(`docs/examples/sources/insurance/claim_{approved,denied,partial}.txt`)
mirror the local eval-pack gold in `observability/local_eval_packs.py` so the
live `--mock` pilot covers approved / denied / partial determinations.
